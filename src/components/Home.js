            <br /> We understand the value of knowledge and thus this e-Library
            is a homogeneous result of our ideas, skills and implementation.

            This library is primarily made for <strong>
              students
            </strong> and <strong>librarian</strong>, however we have included
            an Admin section as well. <br />
            <strong> Students</strong> have access to books and notes. They can
            upload class notes themselves which can be accessed by other
            students. <br />
            <strong> Librarian </strong>has the authority to upload new books to
            the library stack and can delete books as well. <br />
            <strong> Admin</strong> has the power to change the librarian if
            needed.

            doorstep. They get to see all their previous orders along with all
            necessary details at <strong>"Previous Orders"</strong> section.
            <br />
            <strong> Canteen Owner</strong> can add new dishes and delete dishes
            at the same time. They may even change the price or availability of
            any dish at any time they want.

            <strong> College Admin</strong> has the right to change Canteen
