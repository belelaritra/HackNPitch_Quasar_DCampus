## Steps to setup and run this Dapp in localhost:

1. **Fork** and **clone** this repo in local machine.
2. Run `npm install` in the in the project directory. This would install all dependencies.
3. Download **Ganache** from the [official website](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache). Also add & setup **MetaMask** in browser. We recommend you to follow [this](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/truffle-with-metamask).
4. Install `truffle` by following [this](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation).
5. Start **Ganache**, create a `New Workspace`, and add your project by going to the `src` directory and selecting `truffle-config.js`. After this, save this workspace. This would start **Ganache** with 10 ethereum accounts, containg 100 ether each.
6. Now go to `src` directory, open a terminal and run `truffle migrate --reset`. This would compile the smart contracts and deploy the contracts in the local blockchain (Ganache).
7. Open **MetaMask** in your browser and select the network to `custom RPC`. Here, **add** a new network. For this, the RPC URL should be the URL shown in your Ganache. The chain id would be the same as the network id in Ganache.
8. Now select the first account shown in **Ganache**, and click on the `key` icon. This would bring up the private key for the account. Copy this private key. Now go to *MetaMask* (the network should be the custom network you just created), and click on `import account`. Paste the previously copied private key and and click on *import*.
9. MetaMask now should be showing the address of the first *Ganache* account with 100 ether in it. This is your *college admin* account. The one who deploys the contracts in always the *admin*.
10. Run `npm start` in the main project directory. This would start the frontend.

### Refer to this flowchart for the full procedure:

## Steps to carry out the transactions in localhost:

#### At the start, admin is both the librarian and canteen owner.
1. Import some more accounts from *Ganache* into *MetaMask*. Go to `Admin` section in the navbar of the web-application. Now, make one of the newly imported accounts the librarian. Also change the Canteen Owner. (This step is optional, it's just a feature to change the librarian and canteen owner, in case the college authorities want to authorize someone else for managing these sections.)
2. Now the respective addresses can perform the desired transactions. The addresses (other than admin, librarian and canteen owner) can be considered as students.

#### Try changing accounts in *MetaMask* (and then reloading the page) to see which account is authorized to perform the transactions in the page. If an account isn't authorized to perform a certain transaction, the respective button will appear disabled.


# Technologies used: (Development)
1. **Ethereum Blockchain**<br>
2. **IPFS**<br>
3. Web browser extension **Metamask** (recommended) or Nifty wallet.<br>
4. **Truffle**<br>
5. **React** (Html5, Css3, Bootstrap v5.1)<br>
6. **Node.js** (web3.js)<br>
7. **Ganache**<br>

# Technologies used: (Production Build)
1. The previous technologies used during development
2. Front-end deployment: **Netlify**<br>
3. Back-end deployment: **Infura**<br>
   
------
### Note: Using **Brave** browser will save the effort to add and setup Metamask as it has its own built-in wallet.
### Note: **Wait for the previous (or pending) transactions to be completed before attempting any further transactions.** This is because transactions take time to mine, forwarding the same transaction requests before completion of the previous, may result in an undesired output.
